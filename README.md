# EMT_MR
Decoding the coupled decision-making of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metabolic reprogramming in cancer

This work is available as a preprint https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.02.502548v1


# Data Generation

+ For the tristable networks, the code for generating is in coupledWReg_Ccode

+ For the PSF networks, the code is listed under coupledWReg_Ccode/PSF

+ For the cells without hybrid states, the code is listed under normalCells_coupled


# Analysis (crosstalk/analysis)

+ print_data.py
+ aux_func_States.py
+ functions_for_plotting.py
+ reduced_uh.py

+ find_upregs.py prints the information of which parameters (and files) result in upregulated, downregulated, etc expression of the coupled E/M-W/O state


# Figures for SI and main text

They are listed in the draft folder, will need to utilize the data generated from the analysis folder
